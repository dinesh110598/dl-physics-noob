# Deep learning - introduction and some interesting tools for physicists

A bunch of tutorials and some perspective on deep learning for physicists from somebody who's good (or sucks) equally at both these domains. Knowledge of physics in the undergraduate level is assumed, along with pretty good experience in programming. Knowing Julia can be a great bonus but hopefully not a deterrent (most snippets are short and simple), at least in the initial few notebooks. Speaking of which, the site is organised into notebooks which are written using `Pluto.jl` ([Github page](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl)) which can be run interactively with minimal set up.
